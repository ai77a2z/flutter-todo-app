## 📱 Mobile App Store Deployment

### Android - Google Play Store

#### Step 1: Generate Signing Key (One-time setup)
```bash

  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload

# You'll be prompted for passwords - remember these!
```

#### Step 2: Configure App Signing
Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=your-store-password
keyPassword=your-key-password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/Users/yourusername/upload-keystore.jks
```

#### Step 3: Build Release
```bash
# Build App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Or build APK for testing
flutter build apk --release
```

#### Step 4: Upload to Play Store
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create new app ($25 one-time developer fee)
3. Upload `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

# Open iOS project in Xcode
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select your Team in Signing & Capabilities
# 2. Set unique Bundle Identifier
# 3. Choose "Any iOS Device" as target
```

#### Step 3: Build and Archive
```bash
# Build for iOS release
flutter build ios --release

# In Xcode:
